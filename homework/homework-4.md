    - Write the logic to iterate the for loop five times.
    - Print the **i** value for every iteration. Output should be 1,2,3,4,5
    - Call the **fiveTimesForward** from the main method.
    - create a method named **fiveTimesBackWard**.
    - Write the logic to iterate the for loop five times in reverse order.
    - Print the **i** value for every iteration. Output should be 5,4,3,2,1
    - Call the **fiveTimesForward** from the main method.
